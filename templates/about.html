            <h2>Hi there! I'm Shariq,</h2>
            <p>With over a decade of combined experience in software engineering and a fervent commitment to helping
                food bloggers thrive, I'm on a mission to empower your journey.</p>

            <p>Equipped with a BS in Computer Science and an MS in Information Management Systems, I've dedicated
                over eight years to software engineering. My specialty? Crafting personalized tools that tackle
                real-world challenges, specifically designed to support my wife's food blogging venture.</p>

            <p>As someone who has stepped into the world of food blogging alongside my wife, I've personally
                experienced the technical hurdles that can hinder growth. From the intricacies of recipe development
                and photography to website design, SEO, monetization, and analytics - mastering it all is no small
                feat. We achieved 50k monthly sessions on our <a href="https://jamilghar.com" target="_blank"
                                                                 rel="noopener">food blog</a> in under two years.</p>

            <p>That's why I bring together my software engineering prowess to offer tailored solutions exclusively
                for food bloggers. My goal is to lighten the technical load so that you can concentrate on what
                truly matters - crafting enticing recipes and engaging content that resonates with your readers.</p>

            <p>As a solo developer and an adjunct professor, I take pride in delivering white-glove service and
                mentorship to support the journey of food bloggers. My mission is to alleviate the technical
                burdens, whether you're a seasoned blogger or just starting out.</p>

            <p>I'm here to help you navigate the world of food blogging, whether you're an experienced blogger or
                just starting out. I don't just develop tools; I offer personalized coaching and consultations.
                Together, we'll identify the best strategies to amplify your impact and income.</p>

            <p>My decade in web development, combined with my journey in food blogging, equips me with insider
                knowledge of what works in the here and now, not last year. I stay at the forefront of the latest
                trends and technology to provide up-to-the-minute guidance.</p>
